        "Opioids are a class of drugs that include natural, semi-synthetic, and synthetic substances. They interact with opioid receptors in the brain and nervous system to reduce the perception of pain. \
         Common prescription opioids include oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, and codeine, while heroin is an example of an illegal opioid. "

        "Medically, opioids are primarily prescribed for pain management, \
         especially in cases of severe or chronic pain. They are also utilized in \
         treating cough and diarrhea under specific circumstances. "

        "While effective for pain relief, opioids carry significant risks, \
            including the potential for dependence and addiction. \
            Their use can lead to tolerance, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect, \
            and withdrawal symptoms upon cessation. Misuse of opioids has contributed to a widespread public health crisis, \
            with increasing rates of overdose and death. "

    st.write(
        "The use of opioids dates back thousands of years, primarily for pain relief. \
            In modern medicine, their role expanded significantly after the development of inhalational anesthesia \
            in the 19th century, integrating opioids as adjuncts in anesthetic practices."

            certain medical conditions. However, due to their high potential \
            for addiction and misuse, it is essential to use them under strict medical supervision, \
            adhering to prescribed dosages and durations. Awareness and education about the benefits \
            and risks of opioids are vital in addressing the ongoing public health challenges associated with their use."
