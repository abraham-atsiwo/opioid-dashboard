1.	Summary Statistics: Dashboards provide key metrics such as overdose death rates, prescription rates, and demographic information. For example, the CDC’s Drug Poisoning Mortality dashboard presents heat maps and trend lines of county-level drug overdose mortality rates, offering insights into the magnitude and distribution of the crisis.  ￼
	
    
2.	Visualization: Interactive charts and maps allow users to explore data geographically and temporally. Visual analytics solutions help understand trends and identify vulnerable populations. For instance, Tableau’s opioid crisis dashboard visualizes the distribution of opioid claims versus beneficiaries receiving treatment, highlighting disparities and informing targeted interventions.  ￼
	
3.	Modeling: Advanced dashboards incorporate predictive modeling to forecast trends and assess the impact of interventions. Machine learning algorithms can identify at-risk populations and predict future opioid-related events. A health agency case study demonstrated how big data analytics and machine learning identified patients at high risk of opioid abuse and related deaths, enabling proactive treatment strategies.
